How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software with an open mind. My mission is to design the software that completes the expectation of the client, and that will go above and beyond their expectations. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Work on this project has helped me craft problem solving skills. I have been able to analyze code and decide what went wrong with the code. I have used libraries from others, and integrated them with my code to have them up and running. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I first decided what steps I should take at completing the scene. I decided what object I wanted to created first. Then worked from the simplest to the most difficult. This way I could have a polished project and work on the most difficult shapes last. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I can use these tactics by breaking down my future work in milestones to create steps to finishing a project. 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used the ability to break object down into triangles.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Of course, I had to do various iterations to develop.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach has evolved by using more outside sources. I have learned thanks to both education at SNHU and other videos. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My goal is to get a job in computer science. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I can use this in future classes. It gave me more skills in C++.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
It will help me analyze programs and think in basic forms and how the technology is made from scratch.
